# Webpack

## Function

A building task manager, which bundles/manages all your style and javascript files. It sets up tasks based on configurations, and places compiled codes in the appropriate locations to direct tasks. Used only in development. 

### Setting it Up

Webpack's journey has to be set up at a starter file, where it begins to work through that file, its imports, and the imports of the imports, and bundles them all together into one functional JS file.
