# Node Package Manager

## Function

The Node package manager is the pm associated with Node.js, but which is really used for a large part of front end development to manage dependencies and install new techs. 

### How

Npm must be initalized within a projects folder and creates a kind of modules folder where you can store a project's dependent files.

It also drops a package.json file in your directory, that can manage all the dependencies and their configurations.
