# Docker
Category: Platform for launching services 

## TOC


## Uses

### Main Idea
Docker is a platform that allows you to launch containerized services on your machine. Rather than implementing a Virtual Machine to run programs and services that have certaine requirements, Docker allows you to run programs whose requirements may not fit your machine, by abstracting their requirements off of your direct OS and rather through virtual pods constructured through your system's kernel.

### Lightweight
Dockerized containers running programs essentially think they're running on their own machine, fooled by your kernel and Docker, and don't tax your machine intensively; easily allow the handling of many many containers on your machine. Makes it great for local development

### Compatability with Kubernetes 

## Methodology and Shortcuts
